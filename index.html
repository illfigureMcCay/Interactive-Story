                everyone was gone without a trace. Only the weapons and the guards' belongings were left. As he stood in the empty outpost, Emil then 
                faintly heard something odd past the border where the outpost lie. Booming sounds that drew closer, as if a huge mass of people were
                heading this way. He had to make a choice as soon as possible. There was enough time to retreat away from the village, time to run away
                completely, or to stay and defend the village where he stands.",</p>
